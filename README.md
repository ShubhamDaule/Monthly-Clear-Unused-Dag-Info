# Remove Unused DAG Logs Automation 
This code is an example of automating the process of removing unused DAG logs in the context of Airflow, a platform for programmatically authoring, scheduling, and monitoring workflows. The code is written in Python.

## Prerequisites
* Python environment with the required dependencies installed.
* Access to a Google Cloud Platform (GCP) storage bucket.
* Access to an Airflow instance.

## Installation
* Clone the repository or download the code files.

## Configuration
Before running the code, make sure to configure the following settings:
* Update the `to_emails` list with the appropriate email addresses to receive notifications.
* Set the `var3` variable to the desired email subject prefix.
* Replace `YOUR_EMAIL@example.com` with the appropriate email address in the `to_emails` list.
* Adjust the `start_date` value in the `default_args` dictionary to specify when the DAG should start executing.
* Customize the email content in the `report_failure` function if necessary.

## Usage
* Make sure that your Airflow environment is properly set up and running.
* Deploy the code to your Airflow instance, ensuring that the file structure is maintained.
* The code will schedule the `monthly_clear_unused_dag_info` task to run every month on the first day at 6 PM UTC (schedule interval: "0 18 1 * *"). Adjust the schedule_interval as needed.
* The `monthly_clear_unused_dag_info` function queries the DAG models in the Airflow database and checks if the corresponding Python file exists. If not, it removes the DAG from the database.
* The deleted DAG information is stored in a CSV file on a GCP storage bucket. Ensure that you have the necessary permissions and update the `bucket_name` variable accordingly.

## Notes
* This code assumes that you have a functioning Airflow environment with a configured database.
* Adjust the code according to your specific requirements, such as email content, bucket name, etc.
* Please replace the placeholders and configure the code according to your specific setup and requirements before executing it.
